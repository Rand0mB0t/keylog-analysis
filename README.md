This repo contains my first personal project for Exploratory data analysis

These are the question that I am aiming to answer

## BASIC ( EASY ) 
  1. What is the Most used Key ?
  2. What is the Least used Key ?
  3. What are the most used key combos ( experimental question ) ?

## INTERMEDIATE ( MEDIUM ) 
	
  1. Create keyboard HEATMAP
  2. Frequency distribution of keystrokes ( visualise this ) 
  3. look for pwd ( Experimental )

---

## ADVANCE ( HARD ) 

1. Get an idea about active sessions ( time at which i was active ) 
	- Generate visuals for my active sessions in a day - ( Define what do you call a visual )
	- What is the average time of the session ? 
		- WORKDAYS on MON - THU and on FRI (~ bcoz of change in work timings)
		- WEEKENDS Sat and Sun
	- Keeping sessions in mind
      - Keeping sessions in mind , What is (by far) the first key that I press ?
      - find average typing speed 
		ADVANCE use case 
		- Find average typing speed ( minus the records which include backspace ) i.e, What is average speed for perfect typing ?
